# mystopwatch

A basic stopwatch app that displays minutes, seconds and milliseconds and allows users to start, pause and reset the timer.

# context

In this app I've added a teal-colour based theme, a feature of Lap Recording, and used elements such as CircularProgressIndicator to provide a visual representation of the elapsed time within a minute.
